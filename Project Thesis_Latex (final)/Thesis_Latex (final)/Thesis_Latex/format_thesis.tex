Our strategy attracts the cloud server to competently resuscitate the cipher text when another portion framework is appeared by the information proprietor, who is additionally planned to help to counter against beguiling practices of the cloud. It what's more connects with (I) the information proprietor and qualified clients to adequately recognize the authenticity of a client for getting to the information, and (ii) a client to help the data given by different clients to address plaintext recuperation. Veritable examination demonstrates that our methodology can shield qualified clients from misdirecting and ruin irrefutable strikes, for example, the procedure get.}

\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
\section{Overview of the Project}
At present, information improvement with the vivacious movement drives the musicality and pace of society. With the assistance of properties of appropriated setting up that consolidate high flexibility, high constant quality and versatility, consistently more application structures move to the cloud to pass on, for achieving the target of joined relationship of data and gifted utilization of focal core interests. Appropriated selecting improvement has been thoroughly used in the information technique for industry, record and government, which interminably supports the work and life of people; by at that point, sort out information has changed into a major thing resource, whose security can be barely considered. To ensure security of data information in the system condition, cryptography application mode under the cloudiness overseeing condition winds up being especially fundamental. The start of Crypto as a Service (Camas)] made gushed preparing from the bit of data security; it finds another course for the utilization of the cryptography development in the Cloud condition, in like way refreshes the new framework. There into, the security of cloud application is commonly about the examination on terminal mechanical get-together and framework gear kept up by trusted being made, in like seminar on the decided quality and security of re-appropriating estimations; the examination on cloud data security joins perplex, continuation, consistency and picked nature of passed on get-together data; the guaranteed research on the security of cloud hardware with the virtualization are vulnerabilities of contraption working conditions concerning virtualization, security traditions and technique for virtualized structure and security headway of cloud resource pool correspondingly as the upper virtual machine. In spite of that, Alabama Cloud influenced cloud data encryption alliance jointed JN TASS, which is to give liberal data security answers for companys that subject to contraption figure machine referenced by \ac{SCA}. So that, get a couple of information about on cloud cryptography connection that depends on working environments with virtualization work is turning up especially built develop, yet paying little personality to all that it comes up short on the cryptography organization structure with dispersed coordinating model to give cryptography affiliations.

\section{Aim of the Project}
In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient model, called \ac{DSA}, to address the polarity shift problem in sentiment classification. By using the property that sentiment classification has two opposite class labels (i.e., positive and negative), we first propose a data expansion technique by creating sentiment reversed reviews. The original and reversed reviews are constructed in a one-to-one correspondence.

\chapter{SYSTEM ANALYSIS}

\section{Literature Survey}
\subsection{Securing Communications Between External Users and Wireless Body Area Networks}
Remote Body Area Networks are depended upon to see a fundamental occupation in patient-achievement checking soon. Working up secure exchanges between BAN sensors and outside companys is fundamental to paying excellent character to the astonishing security and confirmation concerns. In this paper, we propose the foul abilities to regard a conundrum sharing based Cipher content Policy Attribute-Based Encryption plot, which encodes the data subject to a way structure appeared by the data source. We in like manner structure two customs to safely recuperate the unsafe patient data from a BAN and demonstrate the sensors in a BAN. Our examination demonstrates that the proposed procedure is possible, can give message validness, and can counter possible basic attacks, for instance, interest strikes and battery-weakening ambushes.
\subsection{Secure and Efficient data communication protocol for Wireless Body Area Networks}
Remote Body Area Networks are relied on to expect a key occupation in the field of patient-succeeding checking inside the not extremely far-ousted future, which increases huge idea among specialists beginning late. One of the weights is to build up a guaranteed correspondence working among sensors and clients, while paying unique personality to the outstanding security and security concerns. In this paper, we propose a correspondence sorting out for BANs, and plan a course of action to check the information exchanges between introduced/wearable sensors and the information sink/data clients (bosses or enduring pro) by using Cipher content Policy Attribute Based Encryption (CP ABE) and cutting to store the data in figure content gather at the data sink, in this way ensuring data security. Our procedure achieves an occupation based access control by using a section control tree outlined by the qualities of the information. We in like manner structure two conventions to safely recover the delicate information from a BAN and train the sensors in a BAN. We get some information about the proposed game-plan, and fight that it gives message realness and plot shirking, and is beneficial and sensible.
\subsection{Attribute-Based Encryption for Fine-Grained Access Control of Encrypted Data}
As more sensitive data is shared and stored by third-party sites on the Internet, there will be a need to encrypt data stored at these sites. One drawback of encrypting data, is that it can be selectively shared only at a coarse-grained level (i.e., giving another party your private key). We develop a new cryptosystem for fine-grained sharing of encrypted data that we call Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KPABE). In our cryptosystem, ciphertexts are labeled with sets of attributes and private keys are associated with access structures that control which ciphertexts a user is able to decrypt. We demonstrate the applicability of our construction to sharing of audit-log information and broadcast encryption. Our construction supports delegation of private keys which subsumes  \ac{HIBE}.
\subsection{Body Area Network Security: A Fuzzy Attribute-Based Signcryption Scheme}
Body Area Networks are depended upon to see a fundamental development in the field of patient-flourishing watching soon. While it is major to help secure BAN access to address the undeniable thriving and confirmation concerns, it is correspondingly primary to keep up the adaptability of such achievement endeavors. For example, flexibility is required to ensure that remedial guide staffs approach focal edifying aggregation away in a BAN in making conditions. FABSC utilize satisfying Attribute-based encryption to interface with data encryption, discover the chance to control, and moved drawing for a patient's important information in a BAN. It joins modernized etchings and encryption, and gives enigma, authenticity, enforceability, and plan square. We hypothetically exhibit that FABSC is down to earth and conceivable. We likewise separate its security level in reasonable BANs.
\subsection{An efficient threshold verifiable multi-secret sharing}
In order to fight the drive to set accommodatingly and safely, in 1979, Shamir and Blakely first developed the examinations of the issue sharing (SS) plot. The past relies upon the Lagrange embedding’s polynomial, while the prop up relies upon the direct projective geometry. In these issue sharing there are a few issues as sweeps for after: (1) In each conundrum sharing method only a particular secret can be shared; (2) These riddle sharing are the one-time-use plot, at the day's end once the puzzle has been changed, trader must redistribute another shadow over an ensured channel to each zone; (3) In them two it is standard that the vender and individuals are quick at any rate in sureness it is dazzling in the certifiable word and a confounding shipper may pass on a fake shadow to a particular part or a harmful part may give a fake arrangement to various individuals.
\section{Existing System}
In light of the impulsive idea and volume, re-appropriating cipher texts to a cloud is respected to be a victor among the best approaches for huge data gathering and get to. A little while later, checking the course realness of a company and securely supporting a cipher text in the cloud subject to another space hypothesis allotted by the data owner are two key endeavors to make cloud-based epic data hiding away sensible and impelling. Standard frameworks either absolutely dismiss the issue of access structure animate or delegate the reestablish to a distant ace; paying little respect to after a short time, discover the chance to approach reinforce is fundamental for improving security and dealing with the dynamism achieved by company join and carelessness works.

\chapter{SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS}
These are the requirements for doing the project. Without using these tools and software’s we can’t do the project. So we have two requirements to do the project.\\
1. Hardware Requirements.\\
2. Software Requirements.\\
\section{Hardware Requirements}
The hardware requirements may serve as the basis for a contract for the implementation of the system and should therefore be a complete and consistent specification of the whole system. They are used by software engineers as the starting point for the system design. It shows what the system does and not how it should be implemented.\\

\section{Software Requirements}
The software requirements document is the specification of the system. It should include both a definition and a specification of requirements. It is a set of what the system should do rather than how it should do it. The software requirements provide a basis for creating the software requirements specification. It is useful in estimating cost, planning team activities, performing tasks and tracking the team’s and tracking the team’s progress throughout the development activity.\\

Owner choose the product and details example product id, product name, cost, piece, mediator name, company name, net weight so all details and high level security of encryption and key also developed,  owner  send to mediator side. Mediator user one data receive so check the details, the details also encryption format so all information is print ***** only. Mediator user view the original content and download the product. The mediator user sends to company. Company view the message only star format so company send the request so the owner vie the inbox and accept the query, company view the original data. An efficient and verifiable method to update the cipher text stored in clouds without increasing any risk when the access policy is dynamically changed by the data owner for various reasons. The verifying the shared secret information to prevent users from cheating and can counter various attacks such as the collusion attack.\\

\chapter{DEVELOPMENT TOOLS}
This chapter is about the software language and the tools used in the development of the project. The platform used here is JAVA.\\
\section{Features of Java}
\subsection{The Java Framework}
Java is a programming language originally developed by James Gosling at Microsystems and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++ but has a simpler object model and fewer low-level facilities. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any \ac{JVM} regardless of computer architecture. Java is general-purpose, concurrent, class-based, and object-oriented, and is specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere".\\\\
Java is considered by many as one of the most influential programming languages of the 20th century, and is widely used from application software to web applications the java framework is a new platform independent that simplifies application development internet. Java technology's versatility, efficiency, platform portability, and security make it the ideal technology for network computing. From laptops to datacentres, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere!\\
\subsection{Objectives of Java}
\subsubsection{Why Software Developers Choose Java}
Java has been tested, refined, extended, and proven by a dedicated community. And numbering more than 6.5 million developers, it's the largest and most active on the planet. With its versatility, efficiency, and portability, Java has become invaluable to developers by enabling them to:\\\\
1.Write software on one platform and run it on virtually any other platform.\\
2.Create programs to run within a Web browser and Web services.\\
3.Develop server-side applications for online forums, stores, polls, HTML forms processing, and more.\\
4.Combine applications or services using the Java language to create highly customized applications or services.\\
5.Write powerful and efficient applications for mobile phones, remote processors, low-cost consumer products, and practically any other device with a digital heartbeat.\\
\subsubsection{Some Ways Software Developers Learn Java}
\textbf{•} Today, many colleges and universities offer courses in programming for the Java platform. In addition, developers can also enhance their Java programming skills by reading Sun's java.sun.com Web site, subscribing to Java technology-focused newsletters, using the Java Tutorial and the New to Java Programming Center, and signing up for Web, virtual, or instructor-led courses. \\
\subsubsection{Object Oriented Language}
To be an Object Oriented language, any language must follow at least the four characteristics:-
1.Inheritance: It is the process of creating the new classes and using the behaviour of the existing classes by extending them just to reuse the existing code and adding addition a features as needed.\\
2.Encapsulation: It is the mechanism of combining the information and providing the abstraction.\\
3.Polymorphism: As the name suggest one name multiple form, Polymorphism is the way of providing the different functionality by the functions having the same name based on the signatures of the methods.\\
4.Dynamic binding: Sometimes we don't have the knowledge of objects about their specific types while writing our code. It is the way of providing the maximum functionality to a program about the specific type at runtime.\\
\subsection{Java Server Pages - An Overview}
\ac{JSP} for short is Sun's solution for developing dynamic web sites. JSP provide excellent server side scripting support for creating database driven web applications. JSP enable the developers to directly insert java code into jsp file, this makes the development process very simple and its maintenance also becomes very easy.\\\\
JSP pages are efficient, it loads into the web servers memory  on receiving the request very first time and the subsequent calls are served within a very short period of time.\\\\
In today's environment most web sites servers dynamic pages based on user request. Database is very convenient way to store the data of users and other things. JDBC provide excellent database connectivity in heterogeneous database environment. Using JSP and JDBC it’s very easy to develop database driven web application.\\\\
Java is known for its characteristic of "write once, run anywhere." JSP pages are plat Java Server Pages.Java Server Pages (JSP) technology is the Java platform technology for delivering dynamic content to web clients in a portable, secure and well-defined way. The Java Server Pages specification extends the Java Servlet API to provide web application developers with a robust framework for creating dynamic web content on the server using HTML, and XML templates, and Java code, which is secure, fast, and independent of server platforms.\\\\
JSP has been built on top of the Servlet API and utilizes Servlet semantics. JSP has become the preferred request handler and response mechanism. Although JSP technology is going to be a powerful successor to basic Servlets, they have an evolutionary relationship and can be used in a cooperative and complementary manner.\\\\
Servlets are powerful and sometimes they are a bit cumbersome when it comes to generating complex HTML. Most servlets contain a little code that handles application logic and a lot more code that handles output formatting. This can make it difficult to separate and reuse portions of the code when a different output format is needed. For these reasons, web application developers turn towards JSP as their preferred servlet environment.\\
\subsection{Evolution of Web Applications}
Over the last few years, web server applications have evolved from static to dynamic applications. This evolution became necessary due to some deficiencies in earlier web site design. For example, to put more of business processes on the web, whether in business-to-consumer (B2C) or business-to-business (B2B) markets, conventional web site design technologies are not enough. The main issues, every developer faces when developing web applications, are:\\
1. Scalability :- a successful site will have more users and as the number of users is increasing fast, the web applications have to scale correspondingly.\\
2. Integration of data and business logic :- the web is just another way to conduct business, and so it should be able to use the same middle-tier and data-access code. \\
3. Manageability :- web sites just keep getting bigger and we need some viable mechanism to manage the ever-increasing content and its interaction with business systems. \\
4. Personalization :- adding a personal touch to the web page becomes an essential factor to keep our company coming back again. Knowing their preferences, allowing them to configure the information they view, remembering their past transactions or frequent search keywords are all important in providing feedback and interaction from what is otherwise a fairly one-sided conversation.\\
Apart from these general needs for a business-oriented web site, the necessity for new technologies to create robust, dynamic and compact server-side web applications has been realized. The main characteristics of today's dynamic web server applications are as follows: \\
1. Serve HTML and XML, and stream data to the web client. \\
2. Separate presentation, logic and data. \\
3. Interface to databases, other Java applications and CORBA, directory and mail services. \\
4. Make use of application server middleware to provide transactional support. \\
5. Track client sessions.\\
\subsection{Benefits of JSP}
One of the main reasons why the Java Server Pages technology has evolved into what it is today and it is still evolving is the overwhelming technical need to simplify application design by separating dynamic content from static template display data. Another benefit of utilizing JSP is that it allows to more cleanly separate the roles of web application/HTML designer from a software developer. The JSP technology is blessed with a number of exciting benefits, which are chronicled as follows: \\\\
1. The JSP technology is platform independent, in its dynamic web pages, its web servers, and its underlying server components. That is, JSP pages perform perfectly without any hassle on any platform, run on any web server, and web-enabled application server. The JSP pages can be accessed from any web server. \\\\
2. The JSP technology emphasizes the use of reusable components. These components can be combined or manipulated towards developing more purposeful components and page design. This definitely reduces development time apart from the At development time, JSPs are very different from Servlets, however, they are precompiled into Servlets at run time and executed by a JSP engine which is installed on a Web-enabled application server such as BEA Web Logic and IBM Web Sphere.\\
\section{Servlets}
Earlier in client- server computing, each application had its own client program and it worked as a user interface and need to be installed on each user's personal computer. Most web applications use HTML/XHTML that are mostly supported by all the browsers and web pages are displayed to the client as static documents. \\ 
A web page can merely displays static content and it also lets the user navigate through the content, but a web application provides a more interactive experience. \\
Any computer running Servlets or JSP needs to have a container. A container is nothing but a piece of software responsible for loading, executing and unloading the Servlets and JSP. While servlets can be used to extend the functionality of any Java- enabled server. \\
They are mostly used to extend web servers, and are efficient replacement for \ac{CGI} scripts. \ac{CGI} was one of the earliest and most prominent server side dynamic content solutions, so before going forward it is very important to know the difference between CGI and the Servlets.\\
\section{Java Servlets}
Java Servlet is a generic server extension that means a java class can be loaded dynamically to expand the functionality of a server. Servlets are used with web servers and run inside a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on the server so these are safe and portable. \\
Unlike applets they do not require support for java in the web browser. Unlike CGI, servlets don't use multiple processes to handle separate request. Servlets can be handled by separate threads within the same process. Servlets are also portable and platform independent.\\
A web server is the combination of computer and the program installed on it. Web server interacts with the client through a web browser. It delivers the web pages to the client and to an application by using the web browser and HTTP protocols respectively. \\
The define the web server as the package of  large number of programs installed on a computer connected to Internet or intranet for downloading the requested files using File Transfer Protocol, serving e-mail and building and publishing web pages. A web server works on a client server model.\\

\chapter{SOFTWARE TESTING}
The purpose of testing is to discover errors. Testing is the process of trying to discover every conceivable fault or weakness in a work product. It provides a way to check the functionality of components, sub assemblies, assemblies and/or a finished product It is the process of exercising software with the intent of ensuring that the Software system meets its requirements and user expectations and does not fail in an unacceptable manner. There are various types of test. Each test type addresses a specific testing requirement.
\section{Developing Methodology}
The test process is initiated by developing a comprehensive plan to test the general functionality and special features on a variety of platform combinations. Strict quality control procedures are used.\\
The process verifies that the application meets the requirements specified in the system requirements document and is bug free. The following are the considerations used to develop the framework from developing the testing methodologies.
\section{Types of Tests}
\subsection{Unit Testing}
Unit testing involves the design of test cases that validate that the internal program logic is functioning properly, and that program input produce valid outputs. All decision branches and internal code flow should be validated. It is the testing of individual software units of the application .it is done after the completion of an individual unit before integration. This is a structural testing, that relies on knowledge of its construction and is invasive. Unit tests perform basic tests at component level and test a specific business process, application, and/or system configuration. Unit tests ensure that each unique path of a business process performs accurately to the documented specifications and contains clearly defined inputs and expected results.
\subsection{Functional test}
Functional tests provide systematic demonstrations that functions tested are available as specified by the business and technical requirements, system documentation, and user manuals.\\
Functional testing is centered on the following items:\\
Valid Input : identified classes of valid input must be accepted.\\
Invalid Input : identified classes of invalid input must be rejected.\\
Functions : identified functions must be exercised.\\
Output : identified classes of application outputs must be exercised.\\
Systems/Procedures : interfacing systems or procedures must be invoked.
\subsection{System Test}
System testing ensures that the entire integrated software system meets requirements. It tests a configuration to ensure known and predictable results. An example of system testing is the configuration oriented system integration test. System testing is based on process descriptions and flows, emphasizing pre-driven process links and integration points.
\subsection{Performance Test}
The Performance test ensures that the output be produced within the time limits,and the time taken by the system for compiling, giving response to the users and request being send to the system for to retrieve the results.
\subsection{Integration Testing}
Software integration testing is the incremental integration testing of two or more integrated software components on a single platform to produce failures caused by interface defects.\\\\
The task of the integration test is to check that components or software applications, e.g. components in a software system or – one step up – software applications at the company level – interact without error.
\subsection{Acceptance Testing}
User Acceptance Testing is a critical phase of any project and requires significant participation by the end user. It also ensures that the system meets the functional requirements.\\
\textbf{Acceptance testing for Data Synchronization:}\\
\textbf{•} The Acknowledgements will be received by the Sender Node after the Packets are received by the Destination Node.\\
\textbf{•} The Route add operation is done only when there is a Route request in need.\\
\textbf{•} The Status of Nodes information is done automatically in the Cache Updation process.
\subsection{Build the test plan}
Any project can be divided into units that can be further performed for detailed  processing. Then a testing strategy for each of this unit is carried out. Unit testing helps to identity the possible bugs in the individual component, so the component that has bugs can be identified and can be rectified from errors.









\chapter{Results and Discussion}
\section{Results}
When the Owner, register and log-in into the account and uploads the product details like product id, product name, cost, piece, Customer name, company name and  net weight so all details and high level security of encryption and key also get developed,and owner shares details to Mediator.

This is the Mediator's-Inbox where Mediator could get all the  Product details from the owner. In this Inbox, the Mediator does not have any access to edit the product details which is provided by the owner. The mediator could able to download the product details and can also able to share the details with the Company.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{companyinbox.jpg}
\label{Figure:10} \hspace{10mm}
\caption{\textbf{Company-Inbox Page}}
\end{figure}
In the Company-Inbox, the Company could only receive the product details which are shared by the Mediator. The received details are in encrypted format like"****". To view that details the Campany can request the owner to decrypt it. When the request gets allowed from the owner's side, then only the Company could be able to view and download the Product details.
